Model Interpretation
Class-wise Performance:
Class 2 exhibited excellent performance with a high recall of 0.95, indicating the model’s ability to reliably predict this class.
Class 1, however, showed a lower recall of 0.71, pointing out a difficulty in accurately identifying this class.
Classes 0, 3, and 4 performed reasonably well with good precision and recall, although there were still a few misclassifications.
Confusion Matrix Insights:
The matrix provides a detailed view of where the model made errors. For example, class 1 had higher false positives and false negatives compared to other classes.
Overall Model Performance:
The macro average and weighted average F1-scores are approximately 0.83, suggesting that the model performs reasonably well but there’s room for improvement, especially with class 1.
AUC: The model achieved an AUC of 0.97, indicating excellent overall model discrimination.
Conclusion
The XGBoost model initially achieved an 82.22% accuracy, and after GridSearchCV optimization, reached 77.41% accuracy.
While the model showed strong performance in predicting certain classes (such as class 2), others (like class 1) exhibited lower recall, pointing to areas where the model could be enhanced.
Future work could involve:
Further hyperparameter tuning.
Trying class balancing techniques or ensemble methods to improve performance.
Exploring other machine learning models for better class-wise performance.
This project demonstrates the use of XGBoost and GridSearchCV for model optimization and evaluation. With further improvements, this model could be applied to real-world scenarios where multi-class classification is essential. lti-class classification tasks. Fu

Summary
In this analysis, the XGBoost model was evaluated on a multi-class classification problem, achieving a 77.41% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. The model performed well in most classes, with class 2 achieving high recall, while class 1 showed room for improvement. The overall AUC score of 0.97 reflects strong model discrimination. To improve performance, especially in class 1, future steps could include additional tuning, class balancing techniques, and exploring other machine learning models. This approach offers valuable insights into optimizing XGBoost models for real-world classification tasks.
